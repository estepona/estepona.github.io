Hi, My name is Binghuan Zhang, currently a DevOps engineer at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) working on CI/CD, infrasturcture, and cloud services for the Deep Learning Frameworks department. In the past, I've worked at [Toast](https://pos.toasttab.com/) and [PinOn](https://www.pinon.io/).

I raised two adorable cats at home. Besides work, I write code, play video games, read books, and sometimes write poems. Recently I've been training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu which is so much fun.

My favorite game directors are [Hidetaka Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidetaka_Miyazaki) and [Hideo Kojima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Kojima). My favorite authors are [Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami), [Herman Hesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hesse), and [W. Somerset Maugham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Somerset_Maugham). My favorite poet is [Li Bai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Bai).
