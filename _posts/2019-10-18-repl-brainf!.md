I was exploring different kinds of editors by changing the language from the url in https://repl.it/languages/python3 without first looking at its main website. I was surprised to be able to see `go`, `swift`, `cpp`, `c`... And then I tried something wild: `brainfuck`, and look what I found...

Amazing!!! Maybe you already know that, but if you don't know what Brainfuck is, checkout the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) page... The language is Turing complete and will totally fuxx your brain.
