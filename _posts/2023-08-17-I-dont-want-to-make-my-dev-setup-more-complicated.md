Everything written in another language.

Everything written to link any two or more things.

The list goes on and on...

They are just things I can spit out right out. There are more, and constantly something new on the horizon that promises something great but most of which eventually becomes weight I hate to bear.

I'm master of nothing.

I'm done with all the complications to my already complicated work.

I'm now happy with plain text, no addon, no config, no fancy whatsoever.

Just a few core technologies.

Just the pure original package. Please make it simple and complete. Thanks.
