Recently I'm learning software engineering, not programming.
 
The book I'm reading is the one shown in the header. The English translation of it is "Build to Win - Modern Software Engineering". As the name suggests, it's not about teaching you how to write code or solve an algorithm problem but discussing ways to build software and how to improve the process. I had not thought about reading books like this until several months ago when I started contributing to projects across several teams. Before that, I thought only about improving my coding skills and getting familiar with both the software systems as well as the actual businesses. I was mostly working in one team where I got assigned to specific tickets and reported to only a few people. I guess I was just not exposed to a bigger problem so I didn't realize what it actually means to be a software engineer. And then I got overwhelmed with meetings and chat channels of planning, requirement analysis, and project management besides actual coding and debugging, not to mention other things like root cause analysis and playing Among Us after we hit a milestone. The coding part was trivial compared to everything else. I realized I had to learn more about software engineering.
 
Turns out there's much more to building successful software than writing code. To quote from the book:
 
> Program = Data Structure + Algorithm, and  
> Software = Program + Software Engineering
 
The modern software engineering practice covers topics like testing, pair programming, code review, team workflow, agile, requirement analysis, program management, user experience, quality assurance, provisioning, career development, even ethics, and more. Most of them need to be considered while software engineers are writing the code. For example, what's the code review policy? What source control system should be used? How long should an individual contributor wait until his PR is reviewed? Does the company evaluate the IC's performance by the number of lines changed? What happens after the PR is merged? Is there an automated CI/CD system to pick it up? If there is or should be, what system to use and who should take care of it? Should every PR be associated with a ticket? What's the lifecycle of that ticket? Those are just a small set of questions I could think of immediately.
 
That's why there's an Engineering Manager and Program/Project Manager? lol
 
I guess it's just something you gotta think about when the team grows larger, right? It applies to every kind of system, be it big data or a company, or a country. I enjoy this learning process.
