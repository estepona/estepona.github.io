Didn't figure that the 1st tech book I finished in 2020 is about front-end, and more specifically about UI: [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book/). It's a great book to read and I finished it within 2 days, and I learned A LOT.

I came upon this book when I was trying to use [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework, to a [project](https://github.com/estepona/douban.fm-electron) I've been working on, which I will share more about later after I move everything into [React](https://reactjs.org/). So this book! As basically a layman in the front-end world, I decided to give it a try and just learn it somewhat systematically, and it's been great! You can tell from the cover that the authors have the thing, right? It started with telling you to think about features rather than layouts when you first start a project, and then gradually moved to hierarchy, layout, spacing, then details about colors, fonts, images, and finally telling you how to make the finishing touches and level up. It's simply a great experience reading the book as it's intuitive and shows you comparisons between bad and good designs all the way.

Highly recommend this book to anyone who's interested.
